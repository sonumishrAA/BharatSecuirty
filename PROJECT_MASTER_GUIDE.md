## 🔑 Access Credentials

### Admin Panel Login
*   **URL:** [https://bs-net-admin.netlify.app/login](https://bs-net-admin.netlify.app/login)
*   **Default Email:** `admin@bharatsecurity.org`
*   **Default Password:** `admin123`

> **Note:** If these don't work, ensure you added `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to your Render Environment Variables and restarted the server.

### Database Access
*   **Host:** `dpg-d5cfq55actks73cebasg-a`
*   **User:** `bharat_db_q2he_user`
*   **Database:** `bharat_db_q2he`
*   **Password:** `qFAhP6QWdQs258A2cvDSVNL8zzW0Cw3Z`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**1. "Network Error" or API Issues?**
*   Check if the Backend on Render is **"Live"** (Green).
*   Ensure `CORS_ORIGINS` in Render Environment contains the Netlify link without trailing slashes.

**2. 404 on Refresh?**
*   We added `_redirects` file, so this should not happen. If it does, redeploy the frontend on Netlify.
